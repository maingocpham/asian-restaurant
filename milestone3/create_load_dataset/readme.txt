1. File Descriptions
create.sql: This script is the cornerstone of the Asian_Restaurant database, meticulously defining the schema for its integral tables. These include:
- RESERVATION: Manages customer reservations.
- MENU: Stores details about menu items, including price, category, and cuisine.
- ORDERS: Tracks orders placed by customers, including item details and staff involved.
- PAYMENT: Handles payment records linked to orders and reservations.
- STAFF: Records staff details.
- ADMIN: Records admin details.

load.sql: This script populates the database with initial data for testing and development purposes. It includes entries for reservations, menu, staff, orders, payments, and staff.

2. Important Considerations
The load.sql script requires the structure established by the create.sql script to function correctly. Ensure that create.sql is executed before running load.sql.

3. Data Source
The data used in this project is randomly generated by us. The data are some fictional examples inspired by real-world restaurant management systems
